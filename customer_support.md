# Customer Support — Ready-to-Use Prompts

## 1) Reply to an unhappy customer (refund offered)
You are a support rep for a quick-service restaurant. Be calm, brief, and solution-focused.
Goal: Apologize, confirm issue, offer refund or replacement, and invite them back.

**Prompt**
“Act as a support rep. Draft a reply to a customer whose order was missing an item yesterday at 6:30 PM. Keep it under 120 words, include an apology, confirm refund processed, and offer a replacement on next visit.”

## 2) Turn a 1-star review into a re-visit
**Prompt**
“Write a friendly 3-sentence response inviting the reviewer to DM their order number. Offer a comped meal on their next visit. Keep tone warm, no corporate jargon.”

## 3) Daily inbox triage (summaries + tags)
**Prompt**
“Summarize today’s 25 customer emails into a table with columns: Topic, Urgency (High/Med/Low), Action Owner, Due Date, Suggested Reply Template.”
